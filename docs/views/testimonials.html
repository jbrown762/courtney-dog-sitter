            <p>Courtney is awesome! We are so lucky to have found her! She sent us the most adorable pictures of our fur-babies and they aren't easy to get. Our dogs were so happy and relaxed when we returned from our trip so we knew they were well taken care of. Thank you so much!!!</p>

            <p>Courtney did a wonderful job walking my two dogs! On our meet up, it was evident that she is very knowledgeable about and good with animals--she even caught my escape artist making a break for it. On the walk, she provided pictures of them playing and sent a summary of her visit. She brought a package inside the house for me unasked, and I arrived home to two very satisfied pups. We will definitely use Courtney again!</p>
